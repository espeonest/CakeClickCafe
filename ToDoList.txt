TODO:
- create cake customization stuff
- give alert a proper bg and have text centered in it
- add larger number suffixes
- finish giving menu item prices and all that, balance current prices better
- add a menu with options
- save files
- better background image
- sound effects and music!!!

LOW PRIORITY:
- more items, more images
- name the cafe, change the background, customize cake
- game stats (times clicked, total coins earned, etc)
- auto click?

Potential save file setup:
square brackets indicate placeholder and are not literal

[wallet]
[# of tea]/[# of latte]/[# of cinroll]/etc
[total clicks]/[# items bought total]/[# items sold total]/other stats

using the forward slash as a delimiter obviously
